# Data Sources:
* The data used can be found here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
* A full description on the data can be found here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

# Steps included in the "run_analysis.R" code:
* Merging training data and test data into a single data set.
* Filtering the data set to include only variables related with mean and standard deviation of observations
* The new filtered data set is a dataframe with 10299 rows and 68 columns.
* Assigning descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
* Appropriately labelling the data set with descriptive activity names.
* Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject named "tidy_data.txt".
